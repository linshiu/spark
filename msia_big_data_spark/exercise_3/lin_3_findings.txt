The models for violent vs non-violent crimes suggest similar R sqrd, but the one 
for violent crimes seems to have a much lower MSE.

As expected, the predicted non-violent crimes are higher than that of violent ones.

The results also make sense, where beat 0423 seems to have the highest number of
predicted crimes. Beat 0423 is in the south side of chicago which usually is 
associated to having more dangerous neighborhoods
